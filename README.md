# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard project was created with Javascript, React and Openweather api.

Search a city name to retrieve a 5 day forecast for that area. The forecast includes the date, temp, weather, and wind speed.

You can also save a city to search the forecast quicker or remove other previously saved cities.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
